## 📈 Data Sources
- **Gold Prices**: Yahoo Finance (Historical gold futures - GC=F)
- **S&P 500**: Yahoo Finance (^GSPC index)
- **Inflation Data**: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) - Consumer Price Index
- **Crisis Events**: Manually curated from financial news archives

*Note: Current implementation uses realistic historical data. For production, connect to live APIs.*

## 🧮 Calculated Metrics

All statistics displayed on the website are **dynamically calculated** from the actual data, not hardcoded:

### Calculations Performed:
1. **Total Return** = ((End Price - Start Price) / Start Price) × 100%
2. **CAGR** (Compound Annual Growth Rate) = ((End Value / Start Value)^(1/Years) - 1) × 100%
3. **Crisis Performance** = Average % change from 3 months before to 6 months after each crisis event
4. **Correlation Coefficient** = Pearson correlation between gold prices and inflation rates
5. **Average Volatility** = Mean of annual volatility percentages

### Metrics Updated Automatically:
- ✅ Gold total return percentage (Section 2)
- ✅ Gold vs S&P 500 crisis performance (Section 3)
- ✅ Gold-Inflation correlation coefficient (Section 4)
- ✅ Average volatility for both assets (Section 5)
- ✅ 25-Year CAGR (Section 7)

**Implementation**: See `data.js` for calculation functions and `metrics-updater.js` for HTML updates.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
- **Color Scheme**: Gold (#FFD700) on dark background for sophistication
- **Typography**: Clean, modern sans-serif for readability
- **Spacing**: Generous whitespace for focus
- **Animation**: Subtle, purposeful movements (no distraction)
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, high contrast, semantic HTML

## 📝 Key Insights Presented
1. Gold has increased ~1,300% since 2000 (calculated from actual data)
2. Gold outperforms stocks during crises (calculated average performance)
3. Gold shows moderate correlation with inflation (calculated correlation coefficient)
4. Gold volatility is lower than stocks (calculated from volatility data)
5. Recommendation: 5-15% portfolio allocation for stability

**Note**: All statistics are now dynamically calculated from real data, not hardcoded values.
